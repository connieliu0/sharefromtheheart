    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <p>
      Share your work from your heart on [DATE] at [TIME] and [LOC]! Extremely
      chill 3 min presentation that shows the following things:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>what you made</li>
      <li>why you made it</li>
      <li>how you made it</li>
      <li>where you want to go next</li>
      <li>any open ended questions or thoughts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      depending on the group size, can split into smaller groups around common
      themes for more chill sharing. at the end we'll do an open mingle /
      discussion!
    </p>
    <h3>General guidelines:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>the focus is less on craft and more on the intention</li>
      <li>
        be kind, sharing work is pretty scary so please exercise with care
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Why do you create?</h3>
    <p>
      I like to believe it's because we have something we want to materialize in
      the world!
